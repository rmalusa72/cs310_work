python ver: time problem, got to 13 in two hours
Triangulating: time problem, 208012 in minute and forty seconds
(using doubly linked list for triangulations, arraylist for list of triangulations)
Triangulating2: memory problem, 208012 in four seconds, 742900 in 13 seconds, 2674440 in 1 minute 6 seconds, then out of heap space
(using doubly linked list of doubly linked lists for triangulations, treeset for list of triangulations, list alg of adding ears and rotating)
Triangulating3: memory problem, 208012 in 3 seconds, 742900 in 10 seconds, 2674440 in 36 seconds, then ran out of heap space 2.6 mil into next
(using arraylist of arraylists for triangulations, treeset for list of triangulations, array alg of adding ears in diff spots so more duplicates)
Triangulating4: memory problem, 208012 in 2 seconds, 742900 in 5 seconds, 267440 in 20 seconds, then ran out of heap space 9 mil into next
(using array of array of ints for triangulations, treeset for list, array alg)
Triangulating45: memory problem, 208012 in 1 second, 742900 in 4 seconds, 267440 in 16 seconds, 9694845 in a minute 16, then ran out of heap space 2 mil into the next one
(only change is removing old triangulations from tree as we go)
Triangulating5: inadvertently made everything worse with booleans. i hate this one
Triangulating6: memory problem, 9694845 in a minute 11, then ran out of heap space 3.2 mil into next one
(changed int array to byte array)
